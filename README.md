<b> LOSSIE : ai lost & found tracker </b>
<br>
main motive : <br>
* in campus its most likely that students lose their valuable items like mobiles, laptops, books etc. so we are creating a platform where students can upload their lost items and the found items can be matched with the lost items. <br>
* we are also providing an automated system where the lost items can be matched with the found items. <br>
* no more manual labour, AI is here for you . <br>
<br>
<br>
technology highlights :
* <b> AI : </b> hugging face pre-trained model (BLIP- image captioning)  <br>
* <b> Next.js </b> : for building the frontend of the application. <br>
* <b> Node.js </b> : for building the backend of the application. <br>
* <b> MongoDB </b> : for storing the data of the lost and found items. <br>
